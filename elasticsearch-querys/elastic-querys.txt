## How to delete by query and time range:

{
  "query": {
    "bool": {
      "filter": {
        "range": {
          "dateAdded": {

      }
    }
  }
}


## How to clear cache in the ElasticSearch
## run query:
GET _nodes/stats

## Search “fielddata” under Check the "estimated_size_in_bytes" The limit should be under "limit_size"

      "breakers" : {
        "request" : {
          "limit_size_in_bytes" : 644245094,
          "limit_size" : "614.3mb",
          "estimated_size_in_bytes" : 0,
          "estimated_size" : "0b",
          "overhead" : 1.0,
          "tripped" : 0
        },
        "fielddata" : {
          "limit_size_in_bytes" : 429496729,
          "limit_size" : "409.5mb",
          "estimated_size_in_bytes" : 904,
          "estimated_size" : "904b",
          "overhead" : 1.03,
          "tripped" : 7
        },

## to clear the "estimated_size_in_bytes" run the next query
POST /_all/_cache/clear?fielddata=true

## How search by a range
GET index_name/_search
{  
  "query": {  
    "range": {  
      "dateAdded": {  
        "gte": "2022-11-01 00:00:00.000", 
        "lte": "2022-11-01 23:59:59.999"  
      }  
    }
  }
}

## How to see all the existing indexes  
GET _cat/indices?v

## How to see daily snapshots
GET _cat/snapshots/cs-automated-enc?v

#from the reasult you take one of id and put the example command below
GET _snapshot/cs-automated-enc/PUT THE ID

##How to see repositories for snapshot
GET _cat/repositories

##How to see all the backup snapshots in the environment  
GET _cat/snapshots/backup

##How to create a backup 
insert new snapshot_name  (in the “indices“ section you can insert unique indices)

PUT /_snapshot/backup/snapshot_name?wait_for_completion=true  
{   
"indices": "*",  
"ignore_unavailable": true,  
"include_global_state": true  
}

##How to see what the snapshot include 
GET _snapshot/backup/snapshot_8

## Check the disk space on each node
## You can see the space you have available on each node by running:
GET _nodes/stats/fs

## Check the cluster settings
GET _cluster/settings

## Change the number of replicas for an index
PUT /my-index-000001/_settings
{
  "index" : {
    "number_of_replicas" : 2
  }
}

## Change maximum of shards per node
## this was performed on a very specific situation which was Sales Green environment where we have only 2 nodes but a lot of indexes which although they are small, they are using 5 shards and 1 replica (so 10 shards) each and we reached the maximum of 1000 shards per node. This is a temporary workaround to enable running batches or ingestion

GET _cluster/settings?flat_settings&include_defaults=true
PUT _cluster/settings
{
   "persistent":{
      "cluster.max_shards_per_node": 1250
    }
}
